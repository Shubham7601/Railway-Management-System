# Railway-Management-System
A Railway Management System is a software application built in Python that facilitates the management of railway operations, including train scheduling, ticket booking, passenger information, and station management. This project aims to streamline the booking process for passengers, simplify the scheduling of trains for operators, and improve the overall operational efficiency of railway services. Key features typically include a user-friendly interface for passengers to check train schedules, availability, and fares; an online reservation system for booking tickets; real-time updates on train statuses; and comprehensive data management tools for administrators.

The project structure may include modules for user authentication, route and train management, ticket booking, and reports. For data storage, it might use an SQLite or MySQL database, where tables are designed to store information about trains, routes, schedules, passengers, and booking records. The system can be enhanced further by integrating features like dynamic pricing, seat selection, ticket cancellation, and refund policies.
